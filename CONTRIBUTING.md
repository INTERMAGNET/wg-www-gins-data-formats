Workflow for INTERMAGNET WWW/Gins/Data Format Working Group discussions.

1. To start discussion on a new topic, create an issue in the committee's Github project (https://github.com/INTERMAGNET/wg-www-gins-data-formats/issues) or, if
not a member of the committee, ask a committee member to create an issue (the first method is preferable easier tracking and contribution). If the issue/item is of a private matter, it is placed in a private repository where committee members are given access.

2. Discussion takes place by adding issue comments. Anyone with a github account can comment on issues and anyone given access to the private repository can comment on private issues.

3. Document the result of the discussion in a document in the project. If consensus has emerged, changes to content within this repository should be submitted as a pull request. This may be in the form of documentation of the decision (preferrably markdown for easier updates). Alternatively this may result in other changes to content in the repository. The pull request description should reference the discussion issue (e.g. 'Fixes #XYZ'), and after that has been merged the issue can be closed.

4. If changes are required in other projects, or discussion results in multiple new issues for further discussion, create issues referencing the discussion or reference additional documentation before closing this issue.

5. If it is decided to abandon the issue, a comment should be made describing the reason before it is closed.
